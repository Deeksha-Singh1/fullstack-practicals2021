    <h2>About Fullstack Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Front-end web development</strong>, also known as client-side development is the
      practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web
      Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
      challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and
      techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and
      so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
      developing.

      <strong>Back-end Development</strong> refers to the server-side development. It focuses on
      databases, scripting, website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene
      activities that occur when performing any action on a website. It can be
      an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written
      by back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database
      information.
